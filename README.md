Rent a bike application

to run the app type in the terminal npm run dev i hosted it too and here is the link: https://rent-a-bike-try.web.app

dont judge the desing pls that was not the main goal of this app. The main goal was to learn how to setup technologies like firebase and tailwind and use them. The app has realtime database and auth.
I used lit html for rendering and page js for routing

when you try to run the app if it is throwing an error type in the terminal 'npm install page' and 'npm install lit html'
the hosted version is bundled and i dont know why the bundeled version is doesnt show on github after it was uploaded (maybe it is getting ignored)
