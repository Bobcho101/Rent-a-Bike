Rent a bike application

to run the app type in the terminal npm run dev i hosted it too and here is the link: https://rent-a-bike-try.web.app

dont judge the desing pls that was not the main goal of this app. The main goal was to learn how to setup technologies like firebase and tailwind and use them. The app has realtime database and auth.
I used lit html for rendering and page js for routing
