# Rent-a-Bike

This is project called Rent a Bike. This project's main goal was to learn how to set up technologies like Firebase and Tailwind, and it has a real-time database and authentication. The app uses lit-html for rendering and Page.js for routing.


## How to run the app locally on your machine

1. **Download Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. **Run the app**

    ```
## Check out the hosted version

## Tech Stack
- **lit-html**: *Rendering*
- **page.js**: *Routing*

## Functionality
1. Authentication (*register and login*)
2. Create a post (*only if user*)
3. Every post has a detailed view
4. You can edit and delete a post (*only if owner*)


## Notes
- Please don't judge the design, that was not the main point!!!
- The register and login's tailwind templates are glitched (*idk why*)
